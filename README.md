### FilmQueryProject
The film query project is a fun application that allows users to return movie information across a broad range of movies.
## Description of the project
The film query project allows a user to return information about movies from a movie DB. This application allows the user to search for movies by ID, title keyword, as well as actor information.
## Technologies used
Encapsulation
Constructors
Database as a data source
conditionals
## Issues encountered
Encountered an issue with identifying and reporting null exceptions. This results when the user's search failed to return a value from the DB. Still working through this. Encountered some issues implementing new data pulls but was able to get around those.
